Hi there! Welcome to our Optimistic Ethereum ERC20 Waffle example!

If your preferred smart contract testing framework is Truffle, see our Optimistic Ethereum ERC20 Truffle tutorial [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Truffle-ERC20-Example).

If you're interested in writing your first L2-compatible smart contract using Waffle as your smart contract testing framework, then you've come to the right place!
This repo serves as an example for how go through and compile & test your contracts on both Ethereum and Optimistic Ethereum.

Let's begin!

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you've installed the following before continuing:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setup

To start, clone this `Waffle-ERC20-Example` repo, enter it, and install all of its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Waffle-ERC20-Example.git
cd Waffle-ERC20-Example
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Compile your contracts for Optimistic Ethereum

Compiling a contract for Optimistic Ethereum is pretty easy!
First we'll need to install the [`@eth-optimism/solc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/solc) and [`solc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc) packages.
Since we currently only support `solc` versions `0.5.16`, `0.6.12`, and `0.7.6` for Optimistic Ethereum contracts, we'll be using version `0.7.6` in this example.
Let's add these two packages:

```sh
yarn add @eth-optimism/solc@0.7.6-alpha.1
yarn add solc@0.7.6
```

Next we just need to add a new Waffle config to compile our contracts.
Create `waffle-ovm.json` and add this to it:

```json
{
  "compilerVersion": "./node_modules/@eth-optimism/solc",
  "sourceDirectory": "./contracts",
  "outputDirectory": "./build-ovm"
}
```

Here, we specify the new custom Optimistic Ethereum compiler we just installed and the new build path for our compiled contracts.

And we're ready to compile! All you have to do is specify the `waffle-ovm.json` config in your `waffle` command:

```sh
yarn waffle waffle-ovm.json
```

Our `waffle-ovm.json` config file tells Waffle that we want to use the Optimistic Ethereum solidity compiler.

Yep, it's that easy. You can verify that everything went well by looking for the `build-ovm` directory.

Here, `build-ovm` signifies that the contracts contained in this directory have been compiled for the OVM, the Optimistic Virtual Machine, as opposed to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Now let's move on to testing!

## Step 2: Testing your Optimistic Ethereum contracts

Testing with Waffle is easy. We've included a simple set of ERC20 tests inside [`Waffle-ERC20-Example/test/erc20.test.js`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Waffle-ERC20-Example/blob/main/test/erc20.test.js). Let's run these tests with `waffle`:

```sh
yarn mocha 'test/*.test.js' --timeout 10000
```

If everything went well, you should see a bunch of green checkmarks.

### Testing an Optimistic Ethereum contract

Woot! It's finally time to test our contract on top of Optimistic Ethereum.
But first we'll need to get a local version of an Optimistic Ethereum node running...

-------

Fortunately, we have a [handy dandy repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration) that makes it easy to spin up a local Optimistic Ethereum node!

Since we're going to be using Docker, make sure that Docker is installed on your machine prior to moving on (info on how to do that [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).

Now we just need to install our Optimistic Ethereum node by running:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration.git --recurse-submodules
cd optimism-integration
./pull.sh
```

`./pull.sh` will pull the latest version of all of our docker images and make sure everything else is up to date.

Then we'll run the `./up.sh` command to spin up our node:

```sh
./up.sh
```

Give `./up.sh` a little bit to fully start up (could be up to ~30 seconds).
We'll need to keep this terminal running for the rest of this tutorial (it's your Optimistic Ethereum node). Go ahead and open up a second terminal so that you can run more commands while the other terminal is still running.

You now have your very own locally deployed instance of Optimistic Ethereum! üôå

-------

With your local instance of Optimistic Ethereum up and running, let's test your contracts! Since the two JSON RPC provider URLs (one for your local instance Ethereum and Optimistic Ethereum) have already been specified in your `.env` file, all we need to do next is run the test command.

To do that, run:

```sh
yarn TARGET=OVM mocha 'test/*.test.js' --timeout 50000
```

Notice that we use the `TARGET=OVM` flag to let `mocha` know that we want to use the `build-ovm` folder as our path to our JSON files.
(Remember that these JSON files were compiled using the Optimistic Ethereum solidity compiler!)

You should see a set of passing tests for your ERC20 contract. If so, congrats!
You're ready to deploy an application to Optimistic Ethereum.
It really is that easy.

And uh... yeah. That's pretty much it.
Tutorial complete.
Hopefully now you know the basics of working with Optimistic Ethereum! üÖæÔ∏è

## Further Reading

### OVM vs. EVM Incompatibilities

Our goal is to bring the OVM as close to 100% compatibility with all existing Ethereum projects, but our software is still in an early stage. [Our community hub docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/evm-comparison.html) will maintain the most up to date list of known incompatibilities between the OVM and EVM, along with our plans to fix them.

### Wasn't that easy?

The OVM provides a fresh new take on layer 2 development: it's _mostly_ identical to layer 1 development.
However, there are a few differences that are worth noting, which you can read more about in our [EVM comparison documentation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/evm-comparison.html).
No hoops, no tricks--the Ethereum you know and love, ready to scale up with L2.
